<h1>First Things First</h1>
<p>Welcome. Goatpress is a very special project to me. Every developer and contributor adds something unique to the mix, and together we create something beautiful that I&#8217;m proud to be a part of. Thousands of hours have gone into Goatpress, and we&#8217;re dedicated to making it better every day. Thank you for making it part of your world.</p>

<h1>Installation: Famous 5-minute install</h1>
<ol>
	<li>Unzip the package in an empty directory and upload everything.</li>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="gp-admin/install.php">gp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser. It will take you through the process to set up a <code>gp-config.php</code> file with your database connection details.
		<ol>
			<li>If for some reason this doesn&#8217;t work, don&#8217;t worry. It doesn&#8217;t work on all web hosts. Open up <code>gp-config-sample.php</code> with a text editor like WordPad or similar and fill in your database connection details.</li>
			<li>Save the file as <code>gp-config.php</code> and upload it.</li>
			<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="gp-admin/install.php">gp-admin/install.php</a></span> in your browser.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li>Once the configuration file is set up, the installer will set up the tables needed for your blog. If there is an error, double check your <code>gp-config.php</code> file, and try again. If it fails again, please go to the <a href="https://Goatpress.org/support/" title="Goatpress support">support forums</a> with as much data as you can gather.</li>
	<li><strong>If you did not enter a password, note the password given to you.</strong> If you did not provide a username, it will be <code>admin</code>.</li>
	<li>The installer should then send you to the <a href="gp-login.php">login page</a>. Sign in with the username and password you chose during the installation. If a password was generated for you, you can then click on &#8220;Profile&#8221; to change the password.</li>
</ol>

<h1>Updating</h1>
<h2>Using the Automatic Updater</h2>
<p>If you are updating from version 2.7 or higher, you can use the automatic updater:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Open <span class="file"><a href="gp-admin/update-core.php">gp-admin/update-core.php</a></span> in your browser and follow the instructions.</li>
	<li>You wanted more, perhaps? That&#8217;s it!</li>
</ol>

<h2>Updating Manually</h2>
<ol>
	<li>Before you update anything, make sure you have backup copies of any files you may have modified such as <code>index.php</code>.</li>
	<li>Delete your old Goatpress files, saving ones you&#8217;ve modified.</li>
	<li>Upload the new files.</li>
	<li>Point your browser to <span class="file"><a href="gp-admin/upgrade.php">/gp-admin/upgrade.php</a>.</span></li>
